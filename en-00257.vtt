No, it doesn't work
like that, <i>chamaco.</i>

00:46:40.166 --> 00:46:43.132
Our memories,
they have to be passed down

00:46:43.134 --> 00:46:44.968
by those
who knew us in life...

00:46:44.971 --> 00:46:48.839
in the stories
they tell about us.

00:46:48.841 --> 00:46:51.690
But there's no one left alive
to pass down Cheech's stories.
